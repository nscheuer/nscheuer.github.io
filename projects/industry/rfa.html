        I spent the latter half of 2024 working at Rocket Factory Augsburg, hopping between the GNC (Guidance, Navigation, and Control), OSD (Operational Software Development), Launch, and Aerodynamics Teams. It was a very impactful experience, and I worked on a plethora of different projects. Some highlights:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Creating a day of launch dashboard, merging live datastreams to determine launch windows</li>
        <li>Automation of Monte Carlo simulation pipelines, including failure injection studies</li>
        <li>Writing post-processing scripts for HIL (hardware-in-the-loop) tests.</li>
        <li>Built, networked, and maintained high-altitude weather balloon receiver stations; integrated data into the automated launch availability pipeline</li>
      </ul>
