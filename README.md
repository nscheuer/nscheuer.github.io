# homepage

My homepage. Homepage can be loaded by opening `index.html` in a browser. I made efforts to have the website load as fast as possible.

### Old Homepage
The file `earthindex.html` opens the original, old websit e that I created using [ThreeJS]("https://threejs.org/") and has the Earth rotating with realistic night lighting. Althrough I made quite a lot of efforts to optimize the the website, the skybox takes up too much memory and the loading performance is quite poor.
